Print a progress line as you go — what you are doing, not that you are doing something. A session
whose output has gone quiet is read as stalled and may be relaunched on top of you, which throws
away everything you have not pushed. Never run a command in the background and never end your
turn waiting for one.

Run the gate in the foreground and wait for it. Your last act is `git push`. Never start a
background task you do not wait for. A result with uncommitted or unpushed work is a failed
session (B-0051) and comes back to you as a correction. Say so yourself in the report's
`pushed:` line: `pushed: no` is read as that failure at once.

Anything a human must decide, answer or run is never guessed and never buried in a comment:
print `NEEDS OPERATOR: <what> — <the command or the answer needed>` on its own line, then carry on
with every part of the job that does not depend on it.

Finish with this, and nothing after it:

```
REPORT
item: {item_id}
kind: {kind}
status: done | partial | blocked
branch: {branch}
pushed: yes <the sha origin/{branch} now points at> | rebased <sha> — the factory publishes | no — <why>
commits: <sha> <subject> (one per line, or none)
tests: <what you ran — and its last line>
left out: <what and why, or none>
needs writes: <coder/correct only — repo paths outside writes: that must change too, space-separated, or none>
proves: <code only — the Proves: trailers you wrote, one per line; or none — <why>>
ruling: <adjudicate only — one paragraph: what was disputed, what now holds, what changes; else omit>
blocked_on: <adjudicate only — the id this item must wait for, or none>
writes: <adjudicate only — the corrected footprint, space-separated globs, or none>
superseded_by: <adjudicate only — the id that replaces this item, or none>
NEEDS OPERATOR: <only if something needs a human, else omit>
```
