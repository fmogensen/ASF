Backlog item: T-0001 — Record every payment attempt

## What is already known (do not go looking for it)
Item: T-0001 — Record every payment attempt (task, state New, stage —)
Feature: F-0001 — Checkout survives a failed payment provider
Epic: E-0001 — The storefront holds together under a bad day
Why this session exists: PLAN → CODE — plan approved, footprint free
Branch: `task/T-0001` (exists: no)
Head: abc1234 record the provider outcome
Spec: `docs/specs/checkout-resilience.md` (312 lines)
Plan: `docs/plans/checkout-resilience.md` (188 lines)
Writes (the footprint this job may touch): app/checkout/attempts.py, tests/test_checkout.py
Tests named by the card: tests/test_checkout.py::test_attempt_row_per_try
Sessions in flight: (none)
Specs live in `docs/specs`, plans in `docs/plans`, reviews in `docs/reviews`.
Branch prefixes: fix → `fix`, plan → `plan`, spec → `spec`, task → `task`.
The trunk is `main`; every commit is signed off (`git commit -s`).

### Description
One row per attempt: provider, outcome, latency, order id. Written whether the attempt succeeded
or failed, and never inside the provider client itself.

### Acceptance
- [ ] `tests/test_checkout.py::test_attempt_row_per_try` passes.

### The last report for this item
REPORT
status: partial
left out: the retry itself, F-0001 owns it

### Standing rules
- Commit with `git commit -s`; the sign-off is the record that you did this work.
- Never push to `main`, never force-push, never `--no-verify`, never open a pull request.
- Push your own branch before your turn ends — after every commit, and once at the end even if
  nothing changed.
- Keep a heartbeat: print a progress line as you go; a silent session is read as a dead one and
  relaunched on top of you.
- Finish with the typed REPORT below, as the last thing you print.
- Anything a human must decide or run: `NEEDS OPERATOR: <what> — <the command or the answer>`.

## Your job: build T-0001

Binding: this one Task of `docs/plans/checkout-resilience.md`, and the spec `docs/specs/checkout-resilience.md` behind it. Do exactly this
Task — not the next one, not a cleanup you noticed on the way. Branch `task/T-0001`, cut from
`origin/main`.

THE BOUNDARY IS `writes:` — app/checkout/attempts.py, tests/test_checkout.py
A file outside that list is a refusal, not a judgement call: leave it untouched, and say in the
report under `left out` what you would have changed and why. If a Step cannot be done without
touching one, take the plan's stated expectation for it, record the assumption in the report, and
carry on. The footprint is what lets other sessions run beside you; widening it silently collides
with work you cannot see.

BEFORE THE PUSH: the Task's Gate commands, and its acceptance tests byte-identical from the plan
and passing. Paste the last line of each in the report. A test you changed to make it pass is a
failed Task, not a passed one.

Final message: the pushed sha, the files written, the gate lines, the assumptions recorded.

## The heartbeat, the marker, and the report

Print a progress line as you go — what you are doing, not that you are doing something. A session
whose output has gone quiet is read as stalled and may be relaunched on top of you, which throws
away everything you have not pushed. Never run a command in the background and never end your
turn waiting for one.

Run the gate in the foreground and wait for it. Your last act is `git push`. Never start a
background task you do not wait for. A result with uncommitted or unpushed work is a failed
session (B-0051) and comes back to you as a correction. Say so yourself in the report's
`pushed:` line: `pushed: no` is read as that failure at once.

Anything a human must decide, answer or run is never guessed and never buried in a comment:
print `NEEDS OPERATOR: <what> — <the command or the answer needed>` on its own line, then carry on
with every part of the job that does not depend on it.

Finish with this, and nothing after it:

```
