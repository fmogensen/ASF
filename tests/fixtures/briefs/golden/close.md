Backlog item: T-0001 — Record every payment attempt

## What is already known (do not go looking for it)
Item: T-0001 — Record every payment attempt (task, state New, stage —)
Feature: F-0001 — Checkout survives a failed payment provider
Epic: E-0001 — The storefront holds together under a bad day
Why this session exists: STALE → CLOSE — PR closed unmerged, branch left behind
Branch: `task/T-0001` (exists: no)
Head: abc1234 record the provider outcome
Spec: `docs/specs/checkout-resilience.md` (312 lines)
Plan: `docs/plans/checkout-resilience.md` (188 lines)
Writes (the footprint this job may touch): app/checkout/attempts.py, tests/test_checkout.py
Tests named by the card: tests/test_checkout.py::test_attempt_row_per_try (new)
Sessions in flight: (none)
Specs live in `docs/specs`, plans in `docs/plans`, reviews in `docs/reviews`.
Branch prefixes: fix → `fix`, plan → `plan`, spec → `spec`, task → `task`.
The trunk is `main`; every commit is signed off (`git commit -s`).

### Description
One row per attempt: provider, outcome, latency, order id. Written whether the attempt succeeded
or failed, and never inside the provider client itself.

### Acceptance
- [ ] `tests/test_checkout.py::test_attempt_row_per_try` passes.

### Where to look
`app/checkout/attempts.py` (41 lines)
- record_attempt (def) L10-18
- AttemptStore (class) L20-41
`tests/test_checkout.py` (12 lines)
- test_attempt_row_per_try (def) L3-12
Read only these line ranges first.

### The last report for this item
REPORT
status: partial
left out: the retry itself, F-0001 owns it

### Standing rules
- Commit with `git commit -s`; the sign-off is the record that you did this work.
- Never push to `main`, never force-push, never `--no-verify`, never open a pull request.
- Push your own branch before your turn ends — after every commit, and once at the end even if
  nothing changed.
- Keep a heartbeat: print a progress line as you go; a silent session is read as a dead one and
  relaunched on top of you.
- Finish with the typed REPORT below, as the last thing you print.
- Anything a human must decide or run: `NEEDS OPERATOR: <what> — <the command or the answer>`.
- Every commit subject names the item: `task(T-0001): <what>`. Harvest holds a branch whose commits do not name it; the id inside the branch name does not count.

## Your job: close T-0001 out

It is stale: PR closed unmerged, branch left behind. No session is moving branch `task/T-0001`.

This is one line of work, and no more than one. Write the single line that says **why** it is
closed — what was attempted, and what ended it — and put that line in your report. Do not revive
the work, do not re-open the diff, do not delete anyone's branch, do not touch `main`.

If the work should in fact continue, that is a recommendation, not a decision you take here: say
so in the report in one line and stop. If closing it needs a human — a customer promise, money, a
credential — print `NEEDS OPERATOR:` with the question instead of guessing.

Final message: the one line, and whether the item should be re-opened.

## The heartbeat, the marker, and the report

Print a progress line as you go — what you are doing, not that you are doing something. A session
whose output has gone quiet is read as stalled and may be relaunched on top of you, which throws
away everything you have not pushed. Never run a command in the background and never end your
turn waiting for one.

Run the gate in the foreground and wait for it. Your last act is `git push`. Never start a
background task you do not wait for. A result with uncommitted or unpushed work is a failed
session (B-0051) and comes back to you as a correction. Say so yourself in the report's
`pushed:` line: `pushed: no` is read as that failure at once.

Your branch is `task/T-0001`, and it may already be on origin (`exists:` above — a held branch
comes back to its session, and the worktree was rebased onto `origin/main` before you started;
if `git status` shows a rebase in progress, finish it first). A lane branch is straight commits
on the trunk: never merge `origin/task/T-0001` or `origin/main` into it, never force-push, never
recut it or open another branch. Push with `git push origin task/T-0001`. If that is refused as
non-fast-forward, the rebase is why: stop there — do not merge, do not force — and write
`pushed: rebased <sha> — the factory publishes` in the report; the factory publishes a rebased
lane branch itself (B-0056). Never invent an id: a card id comes from `asf new` or the
`BACKLOG_ID_RANGE` this session was given, and a ruling is never a commit in this repo.

Anything a human must decide, answer or run is never guessed and never buried in a comment:
print `NEEDS OPERATOR: <what> — <the command or the answer needed>` on its own line, then carry on
with every part of the job that does not depend on it.

Finish with this, and nothing after it:
